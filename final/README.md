A program designed to render text on screen.
As this demo stands- it is currently set up to accept a byte from the switches on the board. The currently accepted values are 0 (for space/empty character) to 36 (for 0) with an extra character (37, for a ":"). Use the directional keys for moving the cursor. These buttons MUST be held down. To save the currently selected character into the the lines of text, press the center button of the directional pad.
