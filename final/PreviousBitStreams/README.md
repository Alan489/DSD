Different stages of testing my project.

In order:

**gridTestPattern**
A test bitstream to see the size of each box that will fit the font.
Wound up being a little smaller then anticipated, but I will keep this size.

**BoxColoringTest**
A test to see how well the box position decoding works. This test colors in the boxes 5,5 and 10,10.
