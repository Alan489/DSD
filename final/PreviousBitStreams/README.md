Different stages of testing my project.

In order (Newest to oldest):

**ABC**
New text mapping. This bitstream contains text JKL at the top left and CBA at the bottom right, demonstrating the new mapping capabilities of the most updated bitstream.

**HelloWorld**
No hard coding of exact letters. Displays "Hello World" in a slightly ugly font.

**BoxColoringTest**
A test to see how well the box position decoding works. This test colors in the boxes 5,5 and 10,10.

**gridTestPattern**
A test bitstream to see the size of each box that will fit the font.
Wound up being a little smaller then anticipated, but I will keep this size.
